My project is called: STUDY SMART
Video: <>

For this project, I would like to help students gain better grades through tips and tricks on how to study. Undoubtedly, the top achievers in any school worldwide allocate countless hours to revision and nonstop 'binge' studying. But success can be achieved, if only we use our heads.

To become a successful student, whether it be primary school or college, time management is key. Overworking is definitely not going to help, as it results in stress and, ultimately, losing interest in study. STUDY SMART helps students carefully sort out their schedules to have a perfect balance between leisure and school.

I hope this website helps, and that everyone who uses it improves in some way. If you used my website, thank you very much, I really appreciate it. This was CS50 for me!
