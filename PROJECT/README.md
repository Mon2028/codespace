My project is called: STUDYING
Video: <>

For this project, I would like to help students gain better grades through tips and tricks on how to study. Undoubtedly, the top achievers in any school worldwide allocate countless hours to revision and nonstop 'binge' studying. But success can be achieved, if only we use our heads.

To become a successful student, whether it be primary school or college, time management is key. Overworking is definitely not going to help, as it results in stress and, ultimately, losing interest in study. My project helps students carefully sort out their schedules to have a perfect balance between leisure and school.
