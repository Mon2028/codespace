## Overview
 For this project, I would like to help students gain better grades through tips and tricks on how to study. Undoubtedly, the top achievers in any school worldwide allocate countless hours to revision and nonstop 'binge' studying. But success can be achieved, if only we use our heads.

 To become a successful student, whether it be primary school or college, time management is key. Overworking is definitely not going to help, as it results in stress and, ultimately, losing interest in study. STUDY SMART helps students carefully sort out their schedules to have a perfect balance between leisure and school.

 I was actually thinking of creating a python video game, but I decided to keep on thinking of more productive ideas. And because the word 'productivity' popped into my head, study came into mind.

 It is the most common issue in teenage households. Everywhere, students are struggling with balancing everyday life with their school work and exam preparation. This can lead to mental breakdowns and depression. With these problems, the future generation will not have the tools to make the world into a more advanced and friendly environment.

## Home Page

 The Home page is basically just an introduction to my site, and includes a quote and the title of my project. It is quite like an advertisement. It also includes the symbol of my project, which is a boy reading a book, which is minimalist in nature and comes from the internet. The home page has all the elements required to display my website and act as a flagship page.

 ## About page

The About page talks about why I started STUDY SMART and has the link to my presentation video. This page describes how the website will help, and the background to the website launching. The About page also includes the link to the overview video.

## Study Tips Page

The Study Tips page includes skills and tactics that will help students fare better when preparing for big exams, or just leisurely studying. It includes links to universities like Harvard, Auckland, and Oxford. The tips are all sourced from expert websites and personal opinion. These were taken to average and boiled down to key points.
